<p>
This is the legendary Titanic ML competition ‚Äì the best, first challenge for you to dive into ML competitions and familiarize yourself with how the Kaggle platform works.

The competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

<h3>The Challenge</h3>
<p>
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered ‚Äúunsinkable‚Äù RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren‚Äôt enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: ‚Äúwhat sorts of people were more likely to survive?‚Äù using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

### Overview of How Kaggle‚Äôs Competitions Work
 1. Join the Competition

     Read about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.

2. Get to Work

     Download the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Kernels (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a       prediction file.

3. Make a Submission

     Upload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.

4. Check the Leaderboard

      See how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard.

5. Improve Your Score

### What Data Will I Use in This Competition?
In this competition, you‚Äôll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.

Train.csv will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the ‚Äúground truth‚Äù.

The `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the ‚Äúground truth‚Äù for each passenger. It‚Äôs your job to predict these outcomes.

Using the patterns you find in the train.csv data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in test.csv) survived.

Check out the [‚ÄúData‚Äù tab](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you‚Äôve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.
